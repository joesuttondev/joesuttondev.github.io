This easy vegan chocolate cake is everything you could want in a chocolate cake - moist, rich, and incredibly delicious. Perfect for birthdays, celebrations, or any time you fancy a proper chocolate treat. The best part? You probably have all the ingredients in your pantry already!

**Prep Time:** 20 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 35 minutes  
**Total Time:** 55 minutes  
**Servings:** 12  
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Ingredients

### For the Cake
- 300g plain flour
- 250g caster sugar
- 50g cocoa powder
- 1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- ½ tsp salt
- 350ml plant-based milk (at room temperature)
- 100ml vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract

### For the Chocolate Frosting
- 200g dairy-free butter (at room temperature)
- 400g icing sugar
- 50g cocoa powder
- 2-3 tbsp plant-based milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas Mark 4). Grease and line two 20cm round cake tins with baking parchment.

2. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, caster sugar, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Mix well to combine.

3. In a separate jug, whisk together the plant-based milk, vegetable oil, vinegar, and vanilla extract.

4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Don't overmix - a few small lumps are fine.

5. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared tins. Tap each tin gently on the work surface to remove any air bubbles.

6. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. The tops should spring back when gently pressed.

7. Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely before frosting.

8. Whilst the cakes cool, make the frosting. Beat the dairy-free butter in a large bowl until pale and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

9. Gradually add the icing sugar and cocoa powder, beating well after each addition. Add the plant-based milk one tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency. Beat in the vanilla extract.

10. Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread about a third of the frosting on top. Place the second cake layer on top and use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the cake.

11. For a decorative finish, use a palette knife to create swirls in the frosting. Decorate with fresh berries, chocolate shavings, or leave as is.

## Chef's Notes

**Storage**: This cake keeps well in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the fridge for up to 5 days.

**Make-ahead tip**: The cake layers can be baked a day in advance and stored wrapped in cling film at room temperature. Frost on the day of serving for best results.

**Substitutions**: 
- Use any neutral plant-based milk (oat, soy, almond all work well)
- Swap cocoa powder for 50g melted dairy-free chocolate for an even richer flavour
- Add 1 tsp instant coffee to the wet ingredients to enhance the chocolate flavour

**Variations**:
- Add 100g dairy-free chocolate chips to the batter for extra indulgence
- Sandwich the layers with raspberry jam for a chocolate and raspberry combination
- Top with fresh strawberries for a beautiful presentation
