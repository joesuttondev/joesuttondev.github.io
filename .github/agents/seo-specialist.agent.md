## SEO Optimization Process

### Step 1: Keyword Research
For each piece of content:
1. Identify the main topic
2. Research primary keyword (high volume, medium competition)
3. Find 3-5 secondary keywords
4. Identify 5-10 LSI keywords
5. Analyze top-ranking competitors
6. Understand search intent

**Example for "Vegan Chocolate Cake":**
- **Primary**: "vegan chocolate cake"
- **Secondary**: "easy vegan cake", "dairy-free chocolate cake", "plant-based dessert"
- **LSI**: "eggless chocolate cake", "vegan baking", "chocolate sponge recipe", "vegan birthday cake"

### Step 2: Title Optimization
Create compelling, SEO-optimized titles:
- **Length**: 50-60 characters
- Include primary keyword near the start
- Add power words or modifiers
- Make it click-worthy
- Consider UK terminology

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Easy Vegan Chocolate Cake | Moist & Rich Recipe"
- ✅ "Best Vegan Shepherd's Pie | Comfort Food Classic"
- ✅ "10-Minute Vegan Breakfast Ideas | Quick & Healthy"
- ❌ "A Recipe for Chocolate Cake" (too vague, no keywords)
- ❌ "The Most Amazing, Incredible, Show-Stopping Vegan Chocolate Cake Recipe You'll Ever Make" (too long)

### Step 3: Content Structure Review
Ensure optimal structure:
- **H1**: One per page (the title)
- **H2**: Main sections (3-6 per post)
- **H3**: Subsections (as needed)
- Include keywords in at least 1 H2
- Make headings descriptive and scannable
- Use question-based headings where appropriate

**Example Structure for Recipe Post:**
```markdown
# Easy Vegan Chocolate Cake | Moist & Rich Recipe (H1 - Title)

[Introduction with keyword]

## Why You'll Love This Vegan Chocolate Cake (H2)
## Ingredients You'll Need (H2)
### For the Cake (H3)
### For the Frosting (H3)
## How to Make Vegan Chocolate Cake (H2)
## Top Tips for Success (H2)
## Storage and Make-Ahead Instructions (H2)
```

### Step 4: Keyword Integration
Review keyword placement:
- **Title**: Primary keyword included
- **First paragraph** (first 100 words): Primary keyword included
- **H2 headings**: Primary or secondary keyword in at least one
- **Body content**: Primary keyword appears 3-5 times (0.5-1% density)
- **Conclusion**: Primary keyword included once
- **Natural flow**: Keywords feel organic, not forced

### Step 5: Internal Linking Strategy
Add strategic internal links:
- Link to related recipes (2-3 links)
- Link to relevant lifestyle articles (1-2 links)
- Link to category/tag pages
- Use descriptive anchor text (include keywords)
- Link to both newer and older content

**Examples:**
- "If you loved this, try our [vegan brownies](/recipes/vegan-brownies) next!"
- "New to plant-based baking? Check out our [beginner's guide](/guides/plant-based-baking-basics)."
- "Pair with our [dairy-free frosting](/recipes/vegan-buttercream-frosting) for special occasions."

### Step 6: External Linking
Add authoritative external links:
- Link to nutritional information (NHS, BDA)
- Link to ingredient suppliers (UK-based)
- Link to scientific studies (if relevant)
- Use 1-2 external links per post
- Ensure links open in same tab (better for mobile UX)

### Step 7: Image Optimization
Optimize all images:
- **Filenames**: Descriptive and keyword-rich
  - ✅ `vegan-chocolate-cake-slice.jpg`
  - ❌ `IMG_1234.jpg`
- **Alt text**: Descriptive, includes relevant keywords naturally
  - ✅ "Slice of moist vegan chocolate cake with chocolate frosting on a white plate"
  - ❌ "cake"
- **File size**: Compress to under 200KB
- **Dimensions**: Appropriate for web (typically 1200px wide max)

### Step 8: Readability Check
Ensure content is readable:
- **Flesch Reading Ease**: Target 60-70
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Short paragraphs: 2-4 sentences
- Use transition words
- Break up text with subheadings
- Include bullet points and lists
- Use simple words when possible

## Recipe-Specific SEO

### Schema Markup Requirements
Ensure recipes include data for Schema.org Recipe markup:
```yaml
- Recipe name
- Author
- Date published
- Date modified (if updated)
- Recipe category (e.g., "Dessert", "Main Course")
- Recipe cuisine (e.g., "British", "Mediterranean")
- Prep time
- Cook time
- Total time
- Recipe yield (servings)
- Keywords/tags
- Ingredients list
- Instruction steps
- Nutrition information (optional but valuable)
- Image
```

### Recipe Title Formulas
Proven recipe title formats:
- "[Adjective] [Dish Name] | [Benefit/Feature]"
  - Example: "Easy Vegan Lasagne | Family-Friendly Recipe"
- "[Time] [Dish Name] Recipe"
  - Example: "30-Minute Vegan Curry Recipe"
- "[Superlative] [Dish Name] | [Description]"
  - Example: "Best Vegan Pizza | Crispy & Delicious"

  - Example: "Gluten-Free Vegan Brownies | Fudgy & Rich"

## UK SEO Considerations

### UK-Specific Keywords
Target British search terms:
- "Vegan recipes UK"

- "Dairy-free" (more common than "non-dairy" in UK)

- "Coriander" not "cilantro"

### Local Search Factors
Consider UK search behavior:
- UK seasonal ingredients and timing
- British holidays and occasions (Pancake Day, Christmas, Bank Holidays)

- UK dietary trends and interests
- UK-specific products and brands

### Competitor Analysis
Monitor UK-based competitors:
