```
"This post contains affiliate links. If you purchase through these links, 
we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. We only recommend 
products we genuinely use and believe in."

"*This post includes affiliate links, which means we earn from qualifying 
purchases at no cost to you. All opinions are our own."

"[Affiliate Disclosure] Some links in this post are affiliate links. 
This means if you click and purchase, we may receive a commission. 
We only recommend products we trust and use ourselves."
```

**Placement:**
- At the beginning of the post (after introduction)

- In a visible, separate paragraph
- Can use a subtle background colour box for visibility

#### Per-Link Disclosure

## Essential Equipment for This Recipe

**High-speed blender**: This recipe requires a powerful blender to 
achieve that silky-smooth texture. We've been using [this Vitamix]* 
for three years, and it's been absolutely worth the investment. If 
you're on a budget, [this NutriBullet]* also works well, though you 
may need to blend in smaller batches.
