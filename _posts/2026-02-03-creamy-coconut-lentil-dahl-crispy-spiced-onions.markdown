## Why You'll Love This Recipe

This creamy coconut dahl delivers everything you want in comfort food: it's warming, satisfying, and packed with aromatic spices. The red lentils break down into a silky, luxurious texture whilst the coconut milk adds richness without any dairy. Topped with crispy, golden spiced onions, each spoonful is a perfect balance of creamy and crunchy textures.

It's also incredibly practical - budget-friendly, naturally gluten-free, and comes together in under an hour using mostly store cupboard ingredients. Perfect for meal prep, too!

## Ingredients

### For the Dahl
- 250g red lentils (rinsed and drained)
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (or coconut oil)
- 1 large onion (finely diced)
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 2.5cm piece fresh ginger (peeled and grated)
- 1 green chilli (finely chopped, seeds removed for less heat)
- 1½ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1½ teaspoons ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ teaspoon garam masala
- ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
- 400ml tin coconut milk (full-fat for best creaminess)
- 600ml vegetable stock
- 2 medium tomatoes (roughly chopped)
- 1 teaspoon sea salt (or to taste)
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons fresh coriander (chopped, for garnish)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

### For the Crispy Spiced Onions
- 2 medium onions (thinly sliced into half-moons)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Pinch of sea salt

### To Serve
- Cooked basmati rice or warm naan bread
- Fresh coriander leaves
- Lemon or lime wedges
- Plain coconut yoghurt (optional)

## Method

### Step 1: Prepare the Dahl Base
1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or casserole dish over medium heat.

2. Add the diced onion and cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to turn golden at the edges.

3. Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped green chilli. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, stirring frequently to prevent burning.

### Step 2: Build the Flavour
1. Add all the ground spices (cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and smoked paprika) to the pan. Stir well to coat the onions and cook for 1 minute until the spices become aromatic.

2. Add the rinsed red lentils and stir to coat them in the spiced onion mixture.

3. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable stock, then add the chopped tomatoes. Stir everything together.

### Step 3: Simmer the Dahl
1. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low-medium.

2. Cover the pan partially with a lid (leaving a small gap for steam to escape) and simmer for 25-30 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

3. The dahl is ready when the lentils have completely broken down and the mixture has thickened to a creamy, porridge-like consistency. If it becomes too thick, add a splash of water or stock.

### Step 4: Make the Crispy Spiced Onions
1. Whilst the dahl is simmering, heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.

2. Add the thinly sliced onions and spread them out in an even layer.

3. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onions are deep golden brown and crispy. They should be caramelised but not burnt.

4. In the last minute of cooking, sprinkle over the cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt. Toss to coat evenly.

5. Remove from heat and transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll to drain excess oil.

### Step 5: Finish and Serve
1. Stir the lemon juice into the dahl and taste for seasoning. Add more salt, pepper, or lemon juice as needed.

2. Ladle the dahl into serving bowls over rice or serve alongside warm naan bread.

3. Top generously with the crispy spiced onions and scatter with fresh coriander leaves.

4. Serve with lemon or lime wedges and a dollop of coconut yoghurt if desired.

## Chef's Notes & Tips

### Storage
- **Refrigerate:** Store the dahl (without crispy onions) in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
- **Freeze:** Freezes beautifully for up to 3 months. Defrost overnight in the fridge and reheat gently.
- **Crispy Onions:** Best made fresh, but can be stored in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They may lose some crispness.

### Substitutions
- **Lentils:** Yellow split peas work well, though they take slightly longer to cook.
- **Coconut Milk:** For a lighter version, use half coconut milk and half vegetable stock, though it won't be as rich.
- **Spice Level:** Adjust the green chilli and cayenne pepper to your taste. For mild dahl, omit entirely.
- **Fresh Ginger:** Can substitute with 1 teaspoon ground ginger if needed.

### Make-Ahead Tips
- The dahl can be made up to 2 days ahead and tastes even better as the flavours develop.
- Prepare the crispy onions up to 4 hours ahead and store at room temperature.
- Reheat the dahl gently on the hob, adding a splash of water if needed to loosen.

### Variations
- **Spinach Dahl:** Stir in 100g fresh spinach leaves in the last 2 minutes of cooking until wilted.
- **Sweet Potato Dahl:** Add 1 medium sweet potato (peeled and diced) with the lentils.
- **Protein Boost:** Stir in 200g cooked chickpeas with the lentils for extra protein and texture.
- **Tempered Spices:** For a restaurant-style finish, heat 1 tablespoon oil with 1 teaspoon mustard seeds and curry leaves until they pop, then drizzle over the dahl.

## Serving Suggestions

- **With Rice:** Fluffy basmati rice or brown rice for added fibre
- **With Bread:** Warm naan, chapati, or crispy poppadoms
- **Side Dishes:** Cucumber raita (made with coconut yoghurt), mango chutney, or pickled onions
- **Complete Meal:** Serve with roasted cauliflower or a simple cucumber and tomato salad

## Nutritional Highlights

- **High in Protein & Fibre:** Red lentils provide plant-based protein and fibre for sustained energy
- **Iron-Rich:** Lentils and spinach (if added) are excellent sources of iron
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Turmeric and ginger offer anti-inflammatory benefits
- **Heart-Healthy:** Low in saturated fat and cholesterol-free
- **Budget-Friendly:** Lentils are an economical protein source

## Why This Recipe Works

The secret to incredible dahl lies in layering flavours. By cooking the onions until golden, blooming the spices in oil, and allowing the lentils to simmer slowly, you build depth and complexity. The coconut milk adds luxurious creaminess whilst the crispy onions provide textural contrast that elevates this humble dish to something truly special.

Red lentils are particularly wonderful for dahl because they break down completely, creating that signature silky texture. Unlike other lentils, they don't need pre-soaking and cook relatively quickly, making this an accessible weeknight dinner.
