Imagine starting your winter morning with a bowl of warm, creamy porridge that tastes like sticky toffee pudding for breakfast. This vegan sticky toffee porridge with caramelised apples transforms humble oats into something truly special, combining the rich, caramel flavour of dates with perfectly golden apple slices that melt in your mouth. It's comfort food at its finest, yet surprisingly wholesome and ready in just 20 minutes.

This recipe takes everything we love about traditional sticky toffee pudding – those deep, toffee notes, the tender fruit, the luxurious sauce – and reimagines it as a nourishing breakfast that'll keep you satisfied all morning. The secret? Blending dates directly into the porridge creates that signature sticky toffee flavour whilst adding natural sweetness and a wonderfully creamy texture. Meanwhile, the caramelised apples provide a delightful contrast with their slightly crisp edges and soft, sweet centres.

Whether you're looking for a cosy weekend breakfast treat or a warming start to a chilly February morning, this porridge delivers indulgence without any guilt. It's completely plant-based, naturally sweetened, and packed with fibre and nutrients – but honestly, it just tastes like a proper treat.

- **Cook Time**: 15 minutes
- **Total Time**: 20 minutes
- **Servings**: 2 generous bowls

## Ingredients

### For the Sticky Toffee Porridge:
- 100g rolled oats (use gluten-free if needed)
- 500ml oat milk (or any plant-based milk)
- 6 large Medjool dates (pitted and roughly chopped)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of sea salt
- 2 tbsp plant-based milk (for blending)

### For the Caramelised Apples:
- 2 medium eating apples (such as Braeburn or Cox, cored and sliced into thin wedges)
- 1 tbsp coconut oil (or vegan butter)
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- Pinch of sea salt

### For Serving:
- 2 tbsp chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)
- Extra chopped dates
- Drizzle of maple syrup or date syrup
- Fresh mint leaves (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Date Paste
1. Place 4 of the Medjool dates in a small bowl with 2 tablespoons of plant-based milk and set aside to soften whilst you prepare everything else. This takes about 3-5 minutes and makes them easier to blend into a smooth paste.

### Step 2: Start the Porridge
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the oats, 500ml oat milk, and a pinch of sea salt.
2. Place over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
3. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the oats are creamy and have absorbed most of the liquid. The consistency should be thick but still pourable.

### Step 3: Caramelise the Apples
1. Whilst the porridge cooks, heat the coconut oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat until melted and shimmering.
2. Add the apple slices in a single layer (work in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding) and cook without moving them for 2-3 minutes until golden brown on the bottom.
3. Flip the apples carefully, then drizzle over the maple syrup, sprinkle with cinnamon and salt, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the apples are tender and beautifully caramelised with crispy edges.
4. Remove from heat and set aside, keeping warm.

### Step 4: Create the Sticky Toffee Flavour
1. When the porridge is nearly done, blend the softened dates with their soaking milk using a hand blender or small food processor until completely smooth and paste-like. This creates your sticky toffee sauce.
2. Stir this date paste into the porridge along with the vanilla extract and the remaining 2 chopped dates.
3. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until everything is well combined and the porridge is rich, creamy, and infused with that gorgeous toffee flavour.
4. If the porridge seems too thick, add a splash more plant-based milk to reach your desired consistency.

### Step 5: Serve
1. Divide the sticky toffee porridge between two warmed bowls.
2. Top generously with the caramelised apple slices, arranging them artfully on top.
3. Scatter over the chopped nuts if using, extra chopped dates, and finish with a drizzle of maple syrup or date syrup.
4. Garnish with a sprig of fresh mint if desired, and serve immediately whilst piping hot.

## Serving Suggestions

- **Extra Indulgence**: Add a dollop of coconut yoghurt or vegan cream for an even more luxurious breakfast
- **Nut Butter Swirl**: Drizzle with almond or cashew butter for added protein and richness
- **Berry Boost**: Fresh or frozen raspberries or blackberries provide a lovely tart contrast to the sweet toffee flavour
- **Granola Crunch**: Sprinkle with your favourite granola for added texture
- **Spice It Up**: A pinch of ground ginger or mixed spice adds warming winter flavour
- **Make It a Brunch**: Serve alongside fresh fruit salad and plant-based sausages for a complete breakfast spread

## Storage Tips

- **Refrigerate**: Store leftover porridge in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. The caramelised apples are best stored separately and will keep for 2 days.
- **Reheat**: Add a splash of plant-based milk to the porridge and reheat gently on the hob or in the microwave, stirring frequently. Reheat the apples in a frying pan over low heat for 1-2 minutes to restore their texture.
- **Meal Prep**: Make a batch of the date paste in advance and store it in the fridge for up to 1 week. Simply stir it into freshly cooked porridge each morning for a quick sticky toffee breakfast.
- **Freeze**: The date paste freezes beautifully for up to 3 months. Freeze in ice cube trays and pop one out whenever you want sticky toffee porridge.

## Substitutions & Variations

- **Different Apples**: Try Bramley apples for a tarter flavour, or use pears for a more delicate sweetness. Rhubarb would be lovely in spring!
- **Nut-Free**: Omit the nuts and top with seeds instead (pumpkin or sunflower work brilliantly) or use coconut flakes for crunch.
- **Sugar-Free**: The dates provide all the sweetness needed, but if you want it less sweet, use only 4 dates total and skip the maple syrup drizzle.
- **Protein Boost**: Stir in 1-2 tablespoons of plant-based protein powder or nut butter into the porridge for extra staying power.
- **Gluten-Free**: Use certified gluten-free oats to make this suitable for those with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity.
- **Oil-Free**: Caramelise the apples in a non-stick pan with just the maple syrup and a splash of water instead of using coconut oil.
- **Different Dried Fruit**: If dates aren't your thing, try using dried figs or prunes instead – they'll give a different but equally delicious flavour profile.

## Pro Tips

1. **Choose the Right Dates** - Medjool dates are essential here as they're softer, sweeter, and blend more smoothly than other varieties. They create that authentic sticky toffee flavour.
2. **Don't Rush the Apples** - The key to perfect caramelisation is patience. Let the apples sit undisturbed for 2-3 minutes before flipping to develop those beautiful golden edges.
3. **Adjust Consistency** - Everyone has their porridge preference! Add more milk for a thinner, more pourable porridge, or cook longer for a thicker, more substantial bowl.
4. **Warm Your Bowls** - Pour hot water into your serving bowls whilst cooking to warm them up. This keeps your porridge hotter for longer on cold winter mornings.
5. **Double the Dates** - Some dates get blended for smoothness, whilst the chopped dates provide lovely chewy pieces throughout. This two-date approach creates better texture.
6. **Use Thick Plant Milk** - Oat milk, cashew milk, or soya milk work best for creamy porridge. Thinner milks like almond may need a longer cooking time.
7. **Control the Heat** - Keep the porridge at a gentle simmer rather than a rolling boil. This prevents it from becoming gluey and ensures even cooking.

## Why This Recipe Works

This sticky toffee porridge succeeds because it balances indulgence with wholesomeness. The dates serve triple duty: they sweeten naturally, create that signature toffee flavour, and add a wonderfully creamy texture when blended. Meanwhile, the slow cooking of the oats releases their starches, creating a velvety consistency that feels luxurious on the palate.

The caramelised apples aren't just a pretty garnish – they're essential to the experience. The Maillard reaction that occurs when the apples hit the hot pan creates complex caramel notes that echo and enhance the toffee flavour of the porridge itself. That contrast between the creamy porridge and the slightly crisp apple edges makes every spoonful interesting.

What makes this recipe truly special is how it proves that plant-based breakfast can be both nutritious and utterly indulgent. You're getting whole grains, fruit, and healthy fats, all whilst feeling like you're treating yourself to dessert. It's the kind of breakfast that makes getting out of bed on a cold February morning feel genuinely exciting.
