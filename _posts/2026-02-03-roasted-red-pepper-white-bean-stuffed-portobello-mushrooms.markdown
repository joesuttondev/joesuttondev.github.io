## Ingredients

### For the Mushrooms:
- 4 large portobello mushroom caps, stems removed and gills scraped out
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (or vegetable broth for oil-free)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### For the Filling:
- 1 can (15 oz) white beans (cannellini or great northern), drained and rinsed
- 1 cup roasted red peppers, chopped (jarred or fresh)
- 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped
- 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Herbed Cashew Cream:
- 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked in hot water for 15 minutes
- 1/4 cup water (plus more to adjust consistency)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried)
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 clove garlic
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt

### For Garnish:
- Fresh basil leaves
- Fresh parsley
- Pine nuts (optional)
- Lemon zest

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Mushrooms
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Remove the stems from the portobello mushrooms and use a spoon to gently scrape out the dark gills. This creates more room for the filling and prevents excess moisture.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, olive oil (or broth), minced garlic, salt, and pepper.
4. Brush both sides of the mushroom caps with the balsamic mixture.
5. Place mushrooms gill-side up on the prepared baking sheet.

### Step 2: Make the Filling
1. In a large mixing bowl, roughly mash half of the white beans with a fork, leaving the other half whole for texture.
2. Add the roasted red peppers, cherry tomatoes, garlic, fresh basil, nutritional yeast, oregano, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes (if using).
3. Mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste. The filling should be chunky and well-combined.

### Step 3: Prepare the Herbed Cashew Cream
1. Drain the soaked cashews and add them to a high-speed blender.
2. Add water, lemon juice, dill, parsley, garlic, and salt.
3. Blend on high for 1-2 minutes until completely smooth and creamy. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed to reach a drizzleable consistency.
4. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

### Step 4: Stuff and Bake
1. Generously fill each mushroom cap with the white bean mixture, mounding it slightly.
2. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is heated through. The edges of the mushrooms should be slightly caramelized.

### Step 5: Serve
1. Transfer the stuffed mushrooms to serving plates.
2. Drizzle generously with the herbed cashew cream.
3. Garnish with fresh basil, parsley, pine nuts, and lemon zest.
4. Serve immediately while hot.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve over a bed of quinoa, brown rice, or cauliflower rice
- Pair with a fresh arugula salad dressed with lemon vinaigrette
- Add roasted asparagus or green beans as a side
- Serve with crusty sourdough bread to soak up the delicious cashew cream

## Storage Tips

- **Refrigerate**: Store leftover mushrooms in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The cashew cream can be stored separately for up to 5 days.
- **Reheat**: Warm in a 350°F oven for 10-12 minutes, or microwave until heated through. Add fresh cashew cream after reheating.
- **Meal Prep**: You can prepare the filling and cashew cream up to 2 days in advance. Stuff and bake the mushrooms fresh when ready to eat.

## Substitutions & Variations

- **Nut-Free**: Replace cashew cream with tahini sauce (tahini, lemon juice, garlic, water) or sunflower seed cream
- **Bean Options**: Try chickpeas, black beans, or lentils instead of white beans
- **Greens**: Add sautéed spinach or kale to the filling
- **Spicy Version**: Increase red pepper flakes and add diced jalapeños
- **Italian Style**: Add sun-dried tomatoes and use Italian seasoning
- **Mediterranean Twist**: Top with kalamata olives and vegan feta

## Pro Tips

1. **Don't skip scraping the gills** - This prevents the mushrooms from becoming too watery and creates more space for filling.
2. **Marinate longer for more flavor** - If you have time, marinate the mushrooms in the balsamic mixture for 30 minutes before baking.
3. **Make cashew cream ahead** - The cream thickens when chilled, so you may need to thin it with a splash of water before serving.
4. **Use a high-speed blender** - This ensures your cashew cream is silky smooth. If using a regular blender, soak cashews for at least 4 hours or overnight.
5. **Choose firm mushrooms** - Look for portobello mushrooms that are firm and dry, not slimy or wrinkled.

## Why This Recipe Works

The combination of textures and flavors makes this dish truly special. The meaty portobello provides a substantial base, while the white bean filling offers creaminess and protein. Roasted red peppers add sweetness and depth, and the herbed cashew cream brings everything together with a luxurious, restaurant-quality finish. It's comfort food that nourishes your body and satisfies your soul.
